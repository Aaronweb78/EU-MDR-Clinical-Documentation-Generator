RISK ANALYSIS REPORT
ISO 14971:2019 Compliant

Device: CardioFlow Coronary Stent System
Document Number: RA-CF-2024-001
Date: December 2025

1. INTRODUCTION
This risk analysis has been performed in accordance with ISO 14971:2019 to identify, analyze, and evaluate risks associated with the CardioFlow Coronary Stent System.

2. RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

2.1 Hazard Identification
The following hazards have been identified:
- Stent thrombosis
- Restenosis
- Stent migration
- Allergic reaction to materials
- Perforation of vessel wall
- Stent fracture
- Infection

2.2 Risk Estimation

Hazard: Stent Thrombosis
- Severity: Critical (5)
- Probability: Occasional (3)
- Risk Level: HIGH (15)
- Risk Acceptability: Unacceptable before mitigation

Hazard: Restenosis
- Severity: Serious (4)
- Probability: Occasional (3)
- Risk Level: MEDIUM (12)
- Risk Acceptability: ALARP

Hazard: Allergic Reaction
- Severity: Moderate (3)
- Probability: Remote (2)
- Risk Level: LOW (6)
- Risk Acceptability: Acceptable

Hazard: Vessel Perforation
- Severity: Critical (5)
- Probability: Remote (2)
- Risk Level: MEDIUM (10)
- Risk Acceptability: ALARP

3. RISK CONTROL MEASURES

3.1 Stent Thrombosis Mitigation
- Design: Biocompatible polymer coating
- Clinical: Dual antiplatelet therapy protocol
- Labeling: Clear instructions for use
- Post-market: Surveillance program
- Residual Risk: LOW (3)

3.2 Restenosis Mitigation
- Design: Optimal strut thickness
- Design: Drug-eluting coating under development
- Clinical: Patient selection criteria
- Residual Risk: LOW (4)

3.3 Vessel Perforation Mitigation
- Design: Atraumatic delivery system
- Training: Physician training program
- IFU: Detailed procedural guidance
- Residual Risk: VERY LOW (2)

4. RISK-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
The residual risks are considered acceptable when weighed against the benefits of coronary revascularization in symptomatic patients.

Benefits:
- Restoration of coronary blood flow
- Relief of angina symptoms
- Improved quality of life
- Well-established procedure

5. OVERALL RESIDUAL RISK
After implementation of risk control measures, the overall residual risk is deemed acceptable for the intended use.

6. RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Post-market clinical follow-up will monitor:
- Stent thrombosis rates
- Target lesion revascularization
- Major adverse cardiac events
- Long-term safety and performance

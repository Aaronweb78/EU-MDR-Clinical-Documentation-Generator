CLINICAL STUDY SUMMARY

Study Title: CardioFlow Stent Safety and Efficacy Study
Protocol Number: CF-CS-2024-001
Study Phase: Pivotal Clinical Investigation

1. STUDY OVERVIEW

Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CardioFlow Coronary Stent System in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease.

Study Design: Prospective, multi-center, single-arm study

Study Population:
- Target enrollment: 150 patients
- Actual enrollment: 152 patients
- Completed follow-up: 148 patients

2. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS

Age: Mean 64.3 years (range 42-81)
Gender: 68% male, 32% female
Diabetes: 34% of patients
Previous MI: 28% of patients
Hypertension: 72% of patients

3. PRIMARY ENDPOINT

Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at 12 months:
- Composite of cardiac death, target vessel MI, or clinically-driven target lesion revascularization
- Result: 8.7% (13/148 patients)
- Performance Goal: <15%
- Conclusion: PRIMARY ENDPOINT MET

4. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS

Acute Device Success: 98.0% (149/152)
- Definition: <50% residual stenosis post-procedure

Procedural Success: 96.7% (147/152)
- Definition: Device success without in-hospital MACE

Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) at 12 months: 5.4%
Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR) at 12 months: 6.8%

5. SAFETY RESULTS

Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) at 12 months:
- Cardiac death: 0.7% (1 patient)
- Myocardial infarction: 2.7% (4 patients)
- Stent thrombosis: 1.4% (2 patients)
  - Acute (<24h): 0.7%
  - Subacute (1-30d): 0.7%
  - Late (>30d): 0%

All-cause mortality: 1.4% (2 patients)

6. ADVERSE EVENTS

Total adverse events: 47 events in 38 patients

Serious Adverse Events:
- Cardiovascular: 15 events
- Non-cardiovascular: 8 events

Device-related adverse events: 11 events (7.2% of patients)
- All resolved with appropriate medical management

7. COMPARISON TO LITERATURE

The safety and efficacy results are comparable to or better than published data for similar coronary stent systems in contemporary practice.

8. CONCLUSIONS

The CardioFlow Coronary Stent System demonstrated:
- High procedural success rate (96.7%)
- Low target lesion failure rate (8.7%)
- Acceptable safety profile
- Performance comparable to predicate devices

The benefit-risk profile supports the use of this device in the intended patient population.

9. STUDY LIMITATIONS

- Single-arm design (no randomized control)
- Limited long-term follow-up (12 months)
- Predominantly Caucasian population
- Exclusion of complex lesions

10. POST-MARKET SURVEILLANCE

Ongoing registry study (n=500 patients) for real-world performance data.
Extended follow-up planned to 5 years for enrolled patients.
